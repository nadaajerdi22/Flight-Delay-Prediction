# ✈️ Flight Delay Prediction Using Machine Learning 📊

This project aims to predict flight delays ⏳ using machine learning 🤖 by analyzing historical flight data, including airline, departure time, flight duration, and airport locations 🏢. Built with Python 🐍 and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, the project employs three powerful machine learning models: XGBoost (XGBClassifier) 🚀, MLPClassifier (Multilayer Perceptron) 🧠, and DecisionTreeClassifier 🌳 to identify key factors affecting delays. The workflow includes data preprocessing 🛠️, exploratory data analysis (EDA) 📈, feature selection, and model evaluation 🎯. Insights from this project help airlines and passengers make better decisions, with future improvements such as real-time data integration 🌍 to enhance prediction accuracy.
